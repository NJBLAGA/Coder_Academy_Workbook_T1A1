### **Question 14:**

Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:

 1. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart.

### **Answer 14:**

### **Question 15:**

Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:
You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen *“It’s wet and cold”*, if it is less than 15 but not raining print *“It’s not raining but cold”.* If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print *“It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.*

### **Answer 15:**

### **Question 16:**

An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

- Eggs (1)
- Peanuts (2)
- Shellfish (4)
- Strawberries (8)
- Tomatoes (16)
- Chocolate (32)
- Pollen (64)
- Cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them:
 a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item
 b) the full list of allergies.
